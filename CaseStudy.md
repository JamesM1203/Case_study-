The Transformation of portable devices,

Introduction 
The process behind the development of portable computing was a long and steady process that did happened over the basis of a couple of decades, computers that we have now were once called 'luggables', Laptops and computers began as large desktop computers that weighed 20 pounds and had a boxy shell with a large exterior, in order to reach the area of semi portable these desktops sacraficed a lot of their main hardware reducing their power and battery life, and they depended on heavy external power supplies.
for these machines to operate at the core of their computing was what was described as a silicon heart, which was a part of semiconductor technology that was incredibly tiny and effecient, the development of these small low power processors was a critical turning point for the development of portable computing, these chips allowed for less power usage and allowed for smaller lighter batteries which didnt sacrafice battery life, which allowed solid storage devices to be built in which was faster, reliable, shock resistant and a lot less straining on the device allowing for a significant decrease in battery drainage which allowed the devices to more dependable,
 these early machines were to a degree useless however until they implemented the capability to connect them to a network port, allowing for them to send and recieve signals from a portable location .
 with these developments continuing this allowed for smaller, thinner and more portable devices which allowed for more development of current hardware.
 all of this continued development then lead to the better udnerstanding and development of mobile devices, which excelled the portable computing industry 

Historical Development 
From as early as the 1970's the dream and development of portable computing has drastically improved with thinner portable and more energy effiecient portable devices, with each development and breakthrough in portable advancement the design, prerformance and utility, have achieved higher rates and standards than what was believed possible, below are some of the key advancements and developments in portability history. 

1975 - IBM 5100
    The IBM was one of the earliest portable computers that began the journey and the starting steps to modern computing, however it wasn't perfect and weighed 55 lbs and its design was more like a compact version of a desktop computer, however at the time it was a breakthrough and contained a built in keyboard, monitor and data storage making it the first computer to bring portability to computing 
1981 - OSBORN 1 
    The Osborn 1 was a more consumer friendly version of the IBM 5100 and paved the way of portable community into society, it contained all the same features and abilities of the IBM 5100 however is was significantly lighter weighing only 24.5 lbs 
1989 - COMPAQ LTE 
    The Compaq LTE was the first true portable computing device with a notebook like design allowing for it to fold, it weighed only 7lbs and it was compact and lighteweight and more so resembled the computers and laptops we are familiar with today, it also contained new advanced features such as the development of floppy drive, internal hard drive and a full keyboard 
1991- APPLE POWERBOOK 100
    The Apple powerbook 100 was a groundbreaking portable deivce in the development of laptops, with it weighing only 4.9 lbs it introduced a 9.8 inch monochrome display with an integreated trackball for mouse control and also had an user friendly interface making it more consumer friendly
1994 - IBM THINKPAD 700C 
    The thinkpad made a significant impact to the industry of portable design and development, it contained an LCD screen which a significant upgrade from the monochrome screens and had an innovated design with powerful features, it contained a 10.4 inch screen and had a robust build quality 
2008 - MACBOOK AIR 
    The Macbook airs release made a significant impact on the industry due to its ultra thin design, measuring only 0.16 inches at its thinnest point and weighed only 3lbs,  making it one of the slimmest laptops ever produced at the tiem 
2012 - MICROSOFT SURFACE 
    The microsfot surface made a significant impact to the portability industry due to its astonishing features of combining the abilities of a laptop and a tablet into one, the original surface contained windows RT and featured a 10.6 inch display, aswell as containing a kick stand for free hand use and a detachable type cover keyboard 
2020 APPLE M1 CHIP 
    the unveilement of the apple m1 chip was a groundbreaking moment for computing, its ARM based processor marked apple's transition away from intel chips in their mac lineup, the m1 chip produced high preformentce whilst remaining energy efficient and contained an integrated CPU, GPU RAM and other components 
2022 AND MORE RECENT YEARS 
    in the current decade there is still many developments in the portability industry such as experimenting with the design of laptops and mobile devices, developing new and faster processors, integrating and improving AI on devices, creating devices with longer battery life, integrating the ability for 5G connectivity, Better Biometric security and eco friendly Designs,

First Viewpoint 
The Development of Portable Touch Screens

Just like the development of portable compouters the concept of touch screens was also dreamt about in the 1970's the first iteration for it however wasnt until the 1980's which is when it gained consumers attentions, early systems primarily contained resistive touch screens which relied on pressure applied to the surface to register input, these were only compatible with specialized applications such as point of safle systems and industrial equipment 
the first advancement for touch screens was in 1990's were capacitive touch screens,capacitive touch screens used electrical properties of the human body to detect touch, allowing for multi touch capabilites aswell as allowing for a more responsive experience, this then paved the path for future advancements, 
the first major breakthrough for touch screens was in 2007 with the release of apple's iphone, the iphone had a potentioal for capacative touch tecnology offering both a seamless transition and a smooth interface, the release of the iphone then led to other companies manufacturing company to develop phones with a similar touch screen to release to consumers, 
further developments that have improved the areas are:
high definition displays, OLED and AMOLED tecnology 
durability and touch sensitivity and Flexible displays 
    
Second viewpoint 
The Development of Tablets and other handhelds.
in 1972 the first concept of tablets were by an american computer scientis called "Alan Kay". he designed the dynabook which consisted of a stylus pen and had a thin body with a dispaly that contianed atleast a million pixels, with the development of the dynabook multiple computer engineers suggest parts of the hardware that would work to make the idea work however it was still not capable becasue at the time laptops werent just being developed, a couple years later in 1989 however the first laptop was created, it was called the GRidpad they were called this in correlation to the grid system and because of the graphic tablets that connected to work stations,
however the first true tablet didnt arrive till 1994, created by fujitsu who launched the stylistic 500-tablet that ran on an intel processor and released with windows 95, this was a great development in the history of tablets however in 2010 apple would release the ipad which would then take the biggest step in the advancement of technology, it offered a series of features whilst running apples own OS called IOS, many other company's then followed in apples footsteps to develop better tablets 
currently, the advancement of tablets is being improced by many different companies trying to engineer better and slimmer devices whilst still remaining dependant. 

Ethical reflection 
reflecting on the work iv'e done i now wouldve liked to get more varied sources as well as explore the different subjects on a deeper level instead of having 3 main points and some other standard points, i believe next time i'll be able to build on that and develop a better case study, as well as provide a better perspective on the history and development in the portable industry

conclusion 
to conclude, portable devices reflect one of the longest and most developed journeys that we as a society have developed, beginning from a concept back in the 1970's that spiralled and developed with the help of computer engineers to create better hardware to result in a day to day device that we all use, portable computers have drastically changed how we access and send information aswell as education, entertainment and many other industries, 
these advancements and developments that continue to grow continue to reshape the world around us and how we interact with it

case study
Introduction - Czach
Most people were unaware that a new digital era was about to begin when Apple released the first iPhone in 2007. In Today’s standards, the iPhone OS software installed in that phone was found to be very basic. Still, it brought new concepts, such as smooth scrolling and pinching the touchscreen to zoom in and out. That operating system would evolve and reinvent itself countless times over the course of the eighteen years. It would transform the smartphone into an essential part of everyday life and become the foundation of a complete ecosystem.


Historical development of Mobile phones - Czach

From as early as the late 1800s the concept of wireless communication began to take shape and evolved from basic radio experiments to the modern mobile devices we rely on today. Over the years, advances such as technology, battery design, digital networks and computing power have turned mobile phones from large experimental handheld devices into daily tools that we use every day. 

1876 - The Telephone (Alexander Graham Bell)
The Development of mobile phones began with the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell, Although this device wasn’t portable, this significant development allowed electrical transmission of the voice for the first time, setting the foundation for all future mobile devices.

1947- Cellular Network Concept (Nokia Bell Labs)
Engineers at Nokia Bell Labs proposed the idea of “cellular” network. The concept in which an area is divided into tiny radio cells that hand devices off between towers. This idea became the blueprint for modern mobile phone networks, even though the technology to support it didn’t exist yet.

1973 - First Mobile Phone Call (Motorola DynaTAC)
Martin Cooper of Motorola used the prototype DynaTAC device to make the first handheld mobile phone call. Even though the phone weighed around 2.5 pounds and had a very limited battery life, it was a major breakthrough. At this point, mobile phones became a reality and not just an idea.

1983 - Motorola DynaTAC 8000X (1G Era)
The first commercial mobile phone, the DynaTAC 8000X, was released. It was priced at 3995 dollars which was very expensive at the time. Despite being large, expensive, and allowing only 30 minutes of talk time, it marked the beginning of mobile phone technology and introduced the world to the first generation of cellular network.

1991 - GSM and 2G Networks
GSM, also known as (Global System for Mobile Communications), marked the start of mobile networks. This advance brought clearer calls, better security, and allowed you to send SMS text messages. This would end up being very popular throughout the 1990s.

1999 - First Mobile Internet Access (i-mode)
Japan’s NTT DoCoMo introduced i-mode, the first widely used mobile internet service. This allowed users to check their emails, browse a limited amount of websites/web pages and use online services directly on their phones.
 2001 - First 3G Network
The launch of the third generation of cellular networks made mobile internet more practical. It enabled tons of new features such as video calling, multimedia messaging, which made early smartphones to emerge and become more capable.

2007 - The iPhone (Modern Mobile Device Era Begins)
The entire mobile phone industry was completely transformed by Apple’s introduction of the iPhone. It established a new standard with its multitouch interface, full web browser, and focus on their user friendly design. The iPhone prioritised a smooth experience compared to other smartphones.

2008 - Android and App Stores
Following the iPhone, Android entered the market offering an entirely new open source alternative. On the exact same year, app stores were introduced, allowing third-party developers to create millions of apps. This made most mobile phones from communication devices to powerful handheld computers.

2009-2012 - 4G LTE
The development of the Fourth Generation Long Term Evolution drastically improved mobile internet speeds. This allowed for High definition video streaming, real time gaming, cloud computing and the rise of social media. Phones become faster and small enough to fit into pockets.

2019 - Introduction of 5G Networks
The release of the Fifth Generation Cellular Networks marked another step in mobile device development. With high speeds and lower latency, phones could now support more features such as Artificial Intelligence integration, and improved online gaming and video calls.

2020s and More Recent Years
In the current decade, mobile phone development continues to advance at a rapid rate. Manufacturers are exploring bendable and foldable screens, creating better and more efficient processors, improving battery life and integrating a lot more Artificial Intelligence features into devices. Cameras have also reached professional quality levels and biometric security such as face identification and fingerprint scanning.

Conclusion - Czach
The development of mobile phones has been a long journey. Multiple advancements throughout the years in technology have contributed to the evolution of mobile phones. What started off as early radio and communication experiments has developed into one of the most important gadget in modern times. Every significant event such as the first handheld call, the development of cellular networks, the release of smartphones, and the spread of 5G networks, pushed the limits of what was possible for portable communication.
Mobile devices nowadays are more powerful than computers made back then, and they keep getting smarter, and more connected. As innovation continues, it’s clear that mobile phones will remain an important part with how we communicate and interact with the world around us.

# Historical Evolution of Nokia's Mobile Phones
## **Introduction**
#### All modern devices that have a visual interface have an operating system that helps the user experience the device in a way that makes sense to them, without having extensive computer knowledge. The way operating systems look and function has evolved over the years, older phone started with only the necessary features like calling and storing phone numbers, so there was no need for a flashy software design, nor were there the resources. As phones became more powerful, the more features are added, and the better the operating systems can look.
#### In this text, I will explain the historical evolution and major developments through Nokia’s height of popularity, when mobile phones were very limited in their features, to a point just before the creation of the iPhone, where their empire came crashing down.

## **Historical Evolution**
#### The original Nokia mobile phones from the 90s, like the Nokia 101 (1992), were built on very primitive operating systems, the likes of which you would see on a cheap calculator. They had little functionality past letting you input/call phone numbers, displaying the number you typed, and showing the battery level. It only boasted a 1G Cellular Network Connectivity, which led to poor connectivity in several areas, and didn’t allow for much past voice communication.
#### Nokia made many iterations of this base 101, like the 1011, which had 2G connectivity and was mass produced, Nokia 2010, which could see call history up to 10 calls ago, could receive and send messages and was more affordable than previous models. The 21XX Series (Nokia 2110-2170) all showed slight iterations to connectivity and interface. Despite the minor improvements to each model’s interface, from the 101 to up until the late 2100 series in mid-1996, they all had pretty much the same OS.
#### That was until the Nokia 8810 in 1996, which was Nokia’s first proper “Premium Phone” (They had premium PDAs in the past with phone features, though they didn’t look like phones, and their older phones were sold for exorbitant prices, though it was average for mobile phones to cost that much back then), and ran the “Series 20” User Interface. This phone had applications like a calculator, a calendar and a currency converter, and even featured games like snake. The framework for this phone’s OS would go onto be used in the consumer grade Nokia 3310, which is one of the most popular and well-known phones released by Nokia. The 3310 would allow for customisation to screensavers using a limited in-built paint program, and the transfer of custom ringtones from a desktop computer.
#### Nokia would release the 8310 in 2001, which was their first phone to use the new Series 30 operating system, a system which at the time resembled the Series 20 phones of past years, with added features like DCT4 and GPRS, which would allow for better connectivity and accessibility to FM radio.
#### In 2002, when the Series 30 operating system released, but was still in development, the Nokia 7210 would come with the Series 40 operating system, which was a giant leap forward in terms of software, usability, hardware and telecommunications.  It had an impressive GUI with applications listed in a grid formation (a design choice still used today). This phone would be the first to use a coloured display, as opposed to the calculator-like monochrome LCD display of before, and would now resemble that of a Game Boy Advance. Because of the phone’s GRPS connectivity, it could access a limited part of the internet. The phone had Java Platform 2 Micro Edition support, allowing for the installation of more complex Java applications, and because of its GRPS connectivity, it could download and install java applications through the internet. The phone had a photo gallery, which you could put photos or videos onto by using a computer, or using a camera attachment. Messaging was greatly improved, and you could now send pictures to people through MMS. This would lay the foundation for phones to come.
#### After the release of the 7210 and Series 40, Nokia decided to go back to the Series 30 in 2004 with the Nokia 2600, which like the previous Series 30 phones, was limited in its capabilities in comparison to the Series 40, but shared some characteristics, like the coloured display and EMS (Which allows for sending spreadsheets, like XML files). Apart from that the phone performed mostly the same as any older Series 30 or newer Series 20 phones.
#### There wouldn’t be too much innovation from Nokia’s end in terms of their phones from 2004 onwards, and their almost monopoly over the mobile phone industry would come to an end when Apple released the iPhone, redefining what it meant to own a mobile phone. Nokia would go into smartphone development but wouldn’t find quite the success as they used to have in their peak, especially facing goliaths like Apple. 

## **Viewpoint – Releasing 2 phones per year VS Brute forcing phone releases**
#### Nokia’s business model was to flood the market with differently priced and goal-oriented phones, so whatever your needs were, there was probably a Nokia for you. This opposes iPhone’s business model, which revolves about scheduled releases of 2 or more phones per year, where each product reaches a wide demographic of people, so unless you require a really specific need met, you’re probably best going for the one within your price bracket. Both business models worked, though there is a reason as to why companies stick with iPhone’s model as opposed to Nokia’s model, and so I will cover the pros and cons for each model
### Nokia’s Business Model
#### Nokia back at their height in the 90s and early 00s, released several phones throughout the course of each year, each phone being targeted at a different consumer, with designs and features to reflect their demographic. The naming scheme goes as follows: 
#### **- 1xxx Ultrabasic Phones:** Stripped down features, down the bare essentials (Phone calls, Messaging, Call Records, Monochrome Display)
#### **-	2xxx Basic Phones:** Phones that have more features than the 1xxx series (Bluetooth, Colour Displays)
#### **- 3xxx Mid-range “Expression”:** Phones designed for the youth market, with an emphasis on attractive designs and flashy colours
#### **- 5xxx Mid-range “Active”:** Phones with a rugged design and music features, designed for an outdoors lifestyle
#### **- 6xxx Business Phones:** Phones built with features fit for business people, with the newest operating systems of the time and experimental designs (Candybar, Slide, Clamshell). Designed to be functional and stylish, yet still be affordable.
#### **- 7xxx Fashion and experimental phones:** Phones built for fashion, and made to test features like operating systems and modules like cameras, before implementing into other Nokia phone lines
#### **- 8xxx Premium Phones:** Phones built with ergonomics and design in mind, but with similar internals to other models
#### **- 9xxx Communicator Series:** The highest end of Nokia phone, packed with the most up-to-date features
#### An obvious flaw with having so many mobile phone series is the choice paralysis that would come with so many options of phone with very minor or in some cases major differences. Despite the amount of available Nokia phones at any one time, people would tend to gravitate to the ones tried and tested by their peers, resulting in phones like the Nokia 3310 and 2600 becoming the most popular for each of their respective times.
#### It is important to keep in mind the differences in times that Nokia phones were released in, in comparison to iPhones. Back then it wasn’t seen as a necessity to have the newest and best performing phone, but as a luxury, so people would stick with the device which met their needs and no more. Nowadays most phones come with the same kinds of features, and you could make do with a lower end phone, but you are put through trial and tribulation to work with a lower-end phone’s limitations, like speed, storage, camera quality, network speed and screen size. Back then, if your phone had text messaging, you were ahead of the curve.

#### Apple’s business model with the iPhone learned from Nokia’s mistakes, realising that bigger technological jumps spaced out among slower device releases would benefit everyone in the long run, as everyone would be on the same page in terms of what their phone could do. Apple’s business model was as follows:
#### iPhone: Releasing in June of 2007, providing Apple’s most up-to-date innovations in mobile computing as of the time, in the iPhone OS 1.0, but would allow for upgrades until iPhone OS 3.1.3.
#### - iPhone 3G: Releasing one year and one month after the previous model, and releasing with iPhone OS 2.0, but allowing for upgrades until iOS 4.2.1. Despite the naming scheme having 3 in it, that solely refers to its connectivity to 3G networks, as this is the second iPhone released.
#### - iPhone 3GS: Releasing 11 months after the previous model, and releasing with iPhone OS 3.0, but allowing for upgrades until iOS 6.1.6. The naming scheme of this phone is similar to the previous 3G, though the S in 3GS stand for speed, displaying its faster internet speeds than the previous phone, also fitting since this is the third iPhone released.
#### - iPhone 4: Releasing one year after the previous model, and releasing with iOS 4.0 (shortened to match Apple’s naming scheme for products), but allowing for upgrades until iOS 7.1.2. This phone’s name solely reflects that it is the fourth iPhone.
#### - iPhone 4s: Releasing one year after the previous model, and releasing with iOS 5.0, but allowing for upgrades until iOS 7.1.2. The S in 4s is not specifically defined, though is thought to stand for “Siri”, a virtual assistant added with the release of this phone.
#### - iPhone 5: Releasing one year after the previous model, and releasing with iOS 6.0, but allowing for upgrades until iOS 10.3. Follows same naming scheme as the iPhone 4.
#### - iPhone 5c: Releasing one year after the previous model, and releasing with iOS 7.0, but allowing for upgrades until iOS 10.3.3. The C stands for Colour, since the biggest difference between this and the original was the backplate using coloured polycarbonate (Plastic) instead of aluminium. The specifications are largely the same as the iPhone 5, so not many consumers found this a worthwhile purchase.
#### - iPhone 5s: Releasing on the same day as the iPhone 5s, and releasing with iOS 7.0, but allowing for upgrades until iOS 12.5.7. The S in 5s, similar to the 4s, is not defined, but is thought to represent “Security”, for the addition of Touch ID.	
#### From the iPhone 5s onward, Apple would continue with this kind of scheme for releasing their phones, with a main release coming out, a slightly better or worse version of that phone a year later and moving onto the next main phone release. This scheme worked well for Apple because the line between phone generations was clearly set, allowing for users to know exactly what they would get if they decided to buy any version of the iPhone, and price was based off how old the device was, and how it’s internals compare to the newest phone. People trusted this scheme of phone releases, as opposed to Nokia’s, who would release a bunch of phones at random which were hard to put a date on, or to compare to other phones, because of the naming scheme. 
#### This shows that Apple’s method of releasing their iPhones was better received than Nokia’s phone releases of the past, because they improve customer awareness, and are more recognisable. 

## **Ethical Issues**
#### Nokia’s release method was not sustainable, because the volume of phones released in such a short time would mean that most of those phones wouldn’t see much purchase past the tens of thousands, unless if they were particularly noteworthy. This would result in many phones being created and not sold, creating electronic waste, which is terrible for the environment.
#### The solution to this is to follow a better release method, where phones are developed and created to meet demand, as opposed to being created and hoping a market will find its way to the phone. This happens to be exactly the kind of method that Apple uses with its iPhone.

## **Conclusion**
#### Nokia’s time developing in the mobile phone space was massively important in terms of how we came to the point we’re at now. Their innovation in mobile computing technologies was part of the reason why we have smartphones now, and it’s great to look back and see how ahead of the times they were. Unfortunately, they weren’t able to survive the current tech landscape, and will definitely not be able to come back from their failures, but their impact will never be forgotten.
