The Transformation of portable devices,

Introduction 
The process behind the development of portable computing was a long and steady process that did happened over the basis of a couple of decades, computers that we have now were once called 'luggables', Laptops and computers began as large desktop computers that weighed 20 pounds and had a boxy shell with a large exterior, in order to reach the area of semi portable these desktops sacraficed a lot of their main hardware reducing their power and battery life, and they depended on heavy external power supplies.
for these machines to operate at the core of their computing was what was described as a silicon heart, which was a part of semiconductor technology that was incredibly tiny and effecient, the development of these small low power processors was a critical turning point for the development of portable computing, these chips allowed for less power usage and allowed for smaller lighter batteries which didnt sacrafice battery life, which allowed solid storage devices to be built in which was faster, reliable, shock resistant and a lot less straining on the device allowing for a significant decrease in battery drainage which allowed the devices to more dependable,
 these early machines were to a degree useless however until they implemented the capability to connect them to a network port, allowing for them to send and recieve signals from a portable location .
 with these developments continuing this allowed for smaller, thinner and more portable devices which allowed for more development of current hardware.
 all of this continued development then lead to the better udnerstanding and development of mobile devices, which excelled the portable computing industry 

Historical Development 
From as early as the 1970's the dream and development of portable computing has drastically improved with thinner portable and more energy effiecient portable devices, with each development and breakthrough in portable advancement the design, prerformance and utility, have achieved higher rates and standards than what was believed possible, below are some of the key advancements and developments in portability history.

First Viewpoint 
The Development of Portable Touch Screens

Just like the development of portable compouters the concept of touch screens was also dreamt about in the 1970's the first iteration for it however wasnt until the 1980's which is when it gained consumers attentions, early systems primarily contained resistive touch screens which relied on pressure applied to the surface to register input, these were only compatible with specialized applications such as point of safle systems and industrial equipment 
the first advancement for touch screens was in 1990's were capacitive touch screens,capacitive touch screens used electrical properties of the human body to detect touch, allowing for multi touch capabilites aswell as allowing for a more responsive experience, this then paved the path for future advancements, 
the first major breakthrough for touch screens was in 2007 with the release of apple's iphone, the iphone had a potentioal for capacative touch tecnology offering both a seamless transition and a smooth interface, the release of the iphone then led to other companies manufacturing company to develop phones with a similar touch screen to release to consumers, 
further developments that have improved the areas are:
high definition displays, OLED and AMOLED tecnology 
durability and touch sensitivity and Flexible displays 
    
Second viewpoint 
The Development of Tablets and other handhelds.
in 1972 the first concept of tablets were by an american computer scientis called "Alan Kay". he designed the dynabook which consisted of a stylus pen and had a thin body with a dispaly that contianed atleast a million pixels, with the development of the dynabook multiple computer engineers suggest parts of the hardware that would work to make the idea work however it was still not capable becasue at the time laptops werent just being developed, a couple years later in 1989 however the first laptop was created, it was called the GRidpad they were called this in correlation to the grid system and because of the graphic tablets that connected to work stations,
however the first true tablet didnt arrive till 1994, created by fujitsu who launched the stylistic 500-tablet that ran on an intel processor and released with windows 95, this was a great development in the history of tablets however in 2010 apple would release the ipad which would then take the biggest step in the advancement of technology, it offered a series of features whilst running apples own OS called IOS, many other company's then followed in apples footsteps to develop better tablets 
currently, the advancement of tablets is being improced by many different companies trying to engineer better and slimmer devices whilst still remaining dependant. 

Ethical reflection 
reflecting on the work iv'e done i now wouldve liked to get more varied sources as well as explore the different subjects on a deeper level instead of having 3 main points and some other standard points, i believe next time i'll be able to build on that and develop a better case study, as well as provide a better perspective on the history and development in the portable industry

conclusion 
to conclude, portable devices reflect one of the longest and most developed journeys that we as a society have developed, beginning from a concept back in the 1970's that spiralled and developed with the help of computer engineers to create better hardware to result in a day to day device that we all use, portable computers have drastically changed how we access and send information aswell as education, entertainment and many other industries, 
these advancements and developments that continue to grow continue to reshape the world around us and how we interact with it
