#### Yo this is the way we make our doc and shit

#### I (Charlie) am currently working on the OS section, but I don't remember what other stuff we had to do, so add your own sub-headding under mine

## **2. OS and software evolution**
### Nokia
#### The original Nokia mobile phones from the 90s, like the Nokia 101 (1992), were built on very primitive operating systems, similar to the likes you would see on a cheap calculator. They had little functionality past letting you input/call phone numbers, displaying the number you typed, and showing the battery level. It only boasted a 1G Cellular Network Connectivity, which led to poor connectivity in several areas, and didn’t allow for much past voice communication. 
#### Nokia made many iterations of this base 101, like the 1011, which had 2G connectivity and was mass produced, Nokia 2010, which could see call history up to 10 calls ago, could receive and send messages and was more affordable than previous models, Nokia 2110-2170, which all showed improvement to connectivity and interface. Despite the minor improvements to each model’s interface, from the 101 to up until the late 2100 series in mid 1996, they all had pretty much the same OS.
#### That was until the Nokia 8810 in 1996, which was Nokia’s first proper “Premium Phone” (They had premium PDAs in the past with phone features, though they didn’t look like phones, and their older phones were sold for exorbitant prices, though it was average for mobile phones to cost that much back then), and ran the “Series 20” User Interface. This phone had applications like a calculator, a calendar and a currency converter, and even featured games like snake. The framework for this phone’s OS would go onto be used in the consumer grade Nokia 3310, which is one of the most popular and well-known phones released by Nokia. The 3310 would allow for customisation to screensavers using a limited in-built paint program, and the transfer of custom ringtones from a desktop computer.
